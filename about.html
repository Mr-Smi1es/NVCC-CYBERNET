    <h1 id="heading">What is CyberPunk?</h1>
    <p>Cyberpunk 2077 is a 2020 action role-playing video game developed and published by CD Projekt. The story takes
      place in Night City, an open world set in the Cyberpunk universe. Players assume the first-person perspective of a
      customisable mercenary known as V, who can acquire skills in hacking and machinery with options for melee and
      ranged combat.</p>
    <h1 id="heading">Gameplay</h1>
    <p>Cyberpunk 2077 is played in a first-person perspective as V,[5] a mercenary whose voice,[6] face, hairstyles,
      body type and modifications, background, and clothing are customisable. Stat categories—Body, Intelligence,
      Reflexes, Technical, and Cool—are influenced by the character classes that players assume, which are NetRunner
      (hacking), Techie (machinery), and Solo (combat). V must consult a "ripperdoc" to upgrade and purchase cyberware
      implants; black markets offer military-grade abilities.[7] The rarity of any given equipment is shown by a
      coloured tier system.[8] V can take cover, aim, run, jump, double jump, and slide.[9][10] Melee strikes can be
      dealt with close-combat weapons.[11][12] There are three types of ranged weapons, all of which can be customised
      and modified—Power (standard), Tech (which penetrate walls and enemies), and Smart (with homing bullets).[13][14]
      Ranged weapons are equipped to ricochet bullets in a target's direction and slow them down in bullet time. Four
      types of damage can be inflicted and resisted—Physical, Thermal, EMP, and Chemical.[15][16][17] Weapon use
      increases accuracy and reloading speed, which are manifested in character animations.[18] Gunsmiths repair and
      upgrade weapons.[11] The game can be completed without killing anyone,[19] with non-lethal options for weapons and
      cyberware.[20]

      The open world metropolis Night City, California, consists of six regions—the corporate City Centre,
      immigrant-inhabited Watson, luxurious Westbrook, suburban Heywood, gang-infested Pacifica, and industrial Santo
      Domingo. Its surrounding area, the Badlands, can also be explored. V navigates these locations on foot and in
      vehicles, which are subject to either a third- or first-person view.[7] Pedestrians are vulnerable to vehicular
      collisions.[14] Depending on the location, law enforcement may be alerted if V commits a crime.[21][22] Radio
      stations are available to listen to.[23] The full day-night cycle and dynamic weather affect the way non-player
      characters (NPCs) behave.[13][24] V owns an apartment and a garage.[11][25] Night City features
      non-English-speaking characters, whose languages can be translated with special implants.[26] "Braindance" is a
      device that allows V to undergo other people's experiences.[27][28] Branching dialogues enable interaction with
      NPCs and actions in quests.[29] Experience points are obtained from main quests and fuel the stats; side quests
      yield "street cred", unlocking skills, vendors, places, and additional quests.[8][13][14][30] Quests are acquired
      from characters known as Fixers.[14] Throughout the game, V is aided by various companions.[11] Consumables, like
      soft drinks, are used for healing, and objects can be inspected in V's inventory.[10] Minigames include hacking,
      boxing, auto racing,[31] martial arts, and shooting ranges.[32] Player choice leads to different endings.[28]</p>
