## Website Requirements

- An HTML5 document is created with the main page named as index.html.
- A second HTML5 document is created and named about.html.
  The index.html and about.html are linked to each other correctly.
- Basic HTML5 tags including `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, and `<body>` are correctly used in both pages.
  An external hyperlink `<a href>` to an acceptable site on the Internet is used correctly.
- The image `<img src>` tag links correctly to an image within one of the web pages.
  Paragraph tags `<p>` are used correctly:
- At least one heading tag `(<h1> </h1>, <h2> </h2>)` element is used correctly.
- An ordered `<ol>` AND an unordered list `<ul>` are used correctly.
- An external Cascading Style Sheet named style.css, with CSS elements should include the following:
  - apply a background color to the web page.
  - apply an appropriate color to the heading elements.
  - create a class specifying a font style and color--and apply it correctly.
  - indent and apply curly braces {} correctly.
- Make certain that your index.html and about.html files link to the style.css CSS sheet correctly.
- The content in your web page is unique meaning you are not using the same text, colors, and images used in the example tutorial (or copied/pasted from another website...I will check)
- Both web pages are validated.
  Submit the validation links to this assignment as comments--all pages must validate. Fix anything that is wrong.
- OPTIONAL (not required if you use Repl.it):
  The index.html, about.html, style.css, and all image files (.jpg, .png, .gif) are published to MyDrive.
